		It isn’t every day that a 26 year old former MVP All-Pro quarterback is on the open market, but that was the exact case for Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson. Jackson was the last pick in the first round in 2018 and has exceeded expectations for Baltimore. He was the MVP in 2019, an All Pro, and a two time Pro Bowler. With a career record of 45 wins and 16 losses Jackson has been top 15 in passing touchdowns and top 8 in rushing yards since entering the league in 2018.

		Jackson has been in contract negotiations with the team for over a year now, but that came to an end April 27th as Jackson signed a record breaking deal with the Ravens. The deal made him the highest paid player in the NFL signing a five year deal worth 260 million dollars. Even though the deal went down there was a lot of doubt over the past month. When the Ravens and Jackson couldn’t get a deal done before free agency Baltimore used an exclusive franchise tag on Lamar Jackson. This meant the Ravens still had Jackson’s contract rights, but he could negotiate potential deals with other teams. If Jackson agreed on a deal with another team the Ravens would have been given the opportunity to match it. If they choose not to, they would get the other team’s next two first round picks. The stalemate between the Ravens and Jackson led to him requesting a trade from the team. Baltimore was set on not trading him and after months of back and forth negotiations eventually caved in and gave Lamar Jackson his mega deal

he deserved. Jackson’s new deal placed him highest in the average per year category coming in at 52 million dollars per year. He is only one of three players in the NFL averaging over 50 million per year. All this chaos from Jackson’s negotiations can be attributed to the explosion in recent years in the NFL quarterback market. In 2018 the highest paid quarterback in the NFL was Aaron Rodgers who averaged 33.5 million dollars a year. Going into the 2023 season the 15th highest paid quarterback Jared Goff is making 33.5 million dollars a year. Not only that but since 2018 the highest paid quarterback in the league has accounted for at least 18.5% of their team’s salary cap, but for the 12 years before from 2006-2017 not one of the highest paid quarterbacks hit that percentage and half of them were below 14.5%.

Two of the most influential contracts in recent years that have shaped the quarterback market are Deshaun Watson and Jalen Hurts. In March of 2022 Deshuan Watson signed a five year 230 million dollar contract. This deal would make him the first NFL player ever to sign a fully guaranteed contract. NFL owners hated this contract because no matter if he was playing at a high level or hurt he was going to get his 230 million dollars. On the other hand players were licking their chops over this, especially Lamar Jackson who was due up next for a new contract. NFL media insider Ian Rapoport reported that the “guaranteed money was the heart of the issue” for Jackson

and “that he was seeking as close to 230 million in guaranteed as possible.” This was potentially the reason for the low amount of interest for Jackson. Not many teams were willing to offer a fully guaranteed contract to a quarterback who has missed 10 regular season games in the last two seasons, no matter how talented. The most recent contract

					which inevitably led to the Lamar Jackson contract extension was Jalen Hurts. Ten days before Jackson signed his deal Jalen Hurts agreed to a deal with the Philadelphia Eagles which at the time made him the highest paid NFL player at a five year 255 million dollar contract. All this deal did was really solidify the state of the NFL quarterback market. Hurts had an incredible season leading the Eagles to the Superbowl but with little to none accolades and two years of starting experience it was surprising to see a quarterback like Jalen Hurts get such a huge contract. This deal was definitely an eye opener for the Baltimore Ravens. They knew the market was only going up and that they were going to be forced to pay Lamar. After a year of back and forth the team finally gave in and gave Lamar Jackson a contract that would make him the new highest paid player in the NFL. Now if the Ravens got this deal done months ago they
